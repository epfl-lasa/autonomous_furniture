# TODO


## Clean Git-Repo
-> remove git-history 
-> make sure there is a dedicated data folder which does not store any data...
-> change repo such that the root folder is not `src` anymore

## Code
-> Refactoring / Makes shorter, dedicated meaningful functions
-> Reduce nesting (!)
-> For Future and now: add tests!

## Conceptual
-> There are still quite a few collisions in dense scenarios - why?
-> The safety module introduces very jittery-behavior... This cannot be used no a real robot like that!
-> 3D
